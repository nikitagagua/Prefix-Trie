# Prefix-Trie
here is my implementation of Prefix Trie

Here you can try to serch words by googling algorithm, so you put prefix and get all the words with this prefix

If you want tot try then you should change PATH to your file with words.

A prefix trie, also known as a trie (pronounced "try") or digital tree, is a data structure used for efficiently storing and searching a dynamic set of strings or keys that share a common prefix. It is primarily used for managing and searching for strings or sequences of characters. The prefix trie is based on the following principles:

Tree Structure: A prefix trie is typically represented as a tree where each node represents a single character. The root node is empty, and each level of the tree corresponds to a character in the strings being stored. For example, if you're storing words, each level of the tree represents a letter in a word.

Nodes: Each node in the trie contains:
A character (or a reference to a character in the key).
A flag indicating whether the node represents the end of a valid key (i.e., a complete word).
References to child nodes (usually in the form of a collection, such as an array or map) for each possible next character.
Common Prefix Sharing: The main advantage of a prefix trie is that it shares common prefixes among keys. This means that nodes higher in the tree can be shared among multiple keys that have the same prefix. This property makes tries very space-efficient for storing large sets of strings with shared prefixes.

Efficient Searching: Searching for a key in a prefix trie is very efficient, often taking time proportional to the length of the key being searched, making it an excellent choice for dictionary-style lookups.

Dynamic Insertions and Deletions: Prefix tries can efficiently handle dynamic operations like inserting and deleting keys without excessive memory overhead.

Space Complexity: While tries are efficient for searching and can save space by sharing common prefixes, they can be memory-intensive for large datasets, especially when there is a wide range of possible characters at each position in the keys.

Applications: Tries are commonly used in spell-checking algorithms, autocomplete systems, IP routing tables, and any situation where you need to store and retrieve a set of strings or sequences efficiently.
